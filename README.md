A Brief Introduction
======================

Yield stability is a fundamental aspect for the selection of crop genotypes. The definition of stability is rather complex (see, for example, Annichiarico, 2002); in simple terms, the yield is stable when it does not change much from one environment to the other. It is an important trait, that helps farmers to maintain a good income in most years.

Agronomists and plant breeders are continuosly concerned with the assessment of genotype stability; this is accomplished by planning genotype experiments, where a number of genotypes is compared on randomised complete block designs, with three to five replicates. These experiments are repeated in several years and/or several locations, in order to measure how the environment influences yield level and the ranking of genotypes.

I would like to show an exemplary dataset, referring to a multienvironment experiment with winter wheat. Eight genotypes were compared in seven years in central Italy, on randomised complete block designs with three replicates. The ‘WinterWheat’ dataset is available in the ‘aomisc’ package, which is the accompanying package for this blog
